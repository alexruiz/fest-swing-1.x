Support for testing time-consuming tasks.
</p>
<p>
  A good example is the main window of an application beign shown after the user's credentials have been
  successfully verified. The following are the typical steps to complete such scenario:
</p>      
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>User launches the application</li>
    <li>A login window appears</li>
    <li>User enters her username and password and clicks the &quot;Login&quot; button</li>
    <li>User is authenticated and authorized successfully</li>
    <li>The main window of the application is displayed</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  The &quot;tricky&quot; part here is step 4. Authentication/authorization can take some time (depending on 
  network traffic, etc.) and we need to wait for the main window to appear in order to continue our test. It is 
  possible to test this scenario with FEST:
  <pre>
loginDialog.textBox(&quot;username&quot;).enterText(&quot;yvonne&quot;);
loginDialog.textBox(&quot;password&quot;).enterText(&quot;welcome&quot;);
loginDialog.button(&quot;login&quot;).click();
    
// now the interesting part, we need to wait till the main window is shown.
FrameFixture mainFrame = findFrame(&quot;main&quot;).using(loginDialog.robot);

// we can continue testing the main window.</pre>
</p>
<p>
  The &quot;<code>{@link org.fest.swing.finder.WindowFinder#findFrame(String) findFrame}</code>&quot; method 
  (statically imported from <code>{@link org.fest.swing.finder.WindowFinder}</code>) can lookup a <code>Frame</code> 
  (having &quot;main&quot; as its name) with a default timeout of 5 seconds. That means that if in 5 seconds the 
  frame we are looking for is not found, the test will fail. 
</p>
<p>  
  We can also specify a custom value for the timeout. For example, we can set the timeout to 10 seconds in two ways:
  <pre class="prettyprint">
FrameFixture mainFrame = 
  findFrame("main").withTimeout(10000).using(loginDialog.robot);
// or
FrameFixture mainFrame = 
  findFrame("main").withTimeout(10, SECONDS).using(loginDialog.robot);</pre>        
</p>      
<p>
  We can also look up Frames by type:
  <pre class="prettyprint">
FrameFixture mainFrame = findFrame(MainFrame.class).using(loginDialog.robot);</pre>
</p>
<p>
  Something that you may find weird in the code examples is &quot;<code>using(loginDialog.robot)</code>.&quot; 
  This is necessary because, in a given test, only one instance of 
  <code>{@link org.fest.swing.core.Robot Robot}</code> can be 
  running, to prevent GUI tests from blocking each other on the screen. In another words, in a test class you can 
  only use one and only one instance of <code>Robot</code>.
